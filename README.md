# SpringMvc-Example
<p>The Patient Management System is a robust web application developed using Spring MVC, HTML, CSS, and JDBC, designed to streamline the management of patient records. This system enables users to perform CRUD operations with ease: adding new patient records, deleting outdated or incorrect records, updating existing patient information, and viewing a comprehensive list of all patients.

The application includes a secure login and signup feature, ensuring that only authorized users can access the system. New users can create an account through the signup option, while existing users can log in to manage patient data. This security measure ensures that sensitive patient information is protected and only accessible to authenticated personnel. The intuitive interface, combined with the powerful capabilities of Spring MVC and JDBC, provides a seamless experience for managing patient records, making it an invaluable tool for healthcare providers and administrative staff.</p>
